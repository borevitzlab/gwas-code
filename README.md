# gwas-code
This GWAS code enables time-series GWAS analysis of plant phenotype data outputs from the TraitCapture pipeline (see [TraitCapture.org/resources])
An example dataset of an experiment (BVZ0073) is included in the current release.

Code was written by Riyan Cheng (ric025@ucsd.edu) for Justin Borevitz and the Borevitz Lab as part of the TraitCapture Linkage grant.
